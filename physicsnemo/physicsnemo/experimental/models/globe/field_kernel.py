class Kernel(Module):
    r"""A kernel function for evaluating scalar and vector fields from source points.

    This class implements a learnable neural-network-based kernel function that
    computes scalar and vector fields at target points based on the influence of
    source points with associated normals and strengths. The kernel uses a Pade
    rational neural network to model the field interactions while preserving
    physical properties such as proper far-field decay rates, translational
    invariance, rotational invariance, parity invariance, and scale invariance.

    The kernel takes as input the relative positions, orientations, and magnitudes
    of source points, then outputs field values that are consistent with physical
    conservation laws. For vector fields, the output is automatically reprojected
    onto a local coordinate system to maintain rotational invariance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_spatial_dims : int
        Number of spatial dimensions (2 or 3).
    output_field_ranks : TensorDict
        Rank-spec TensorDict with integer leaves (0 = scalar, 1 = vector)
        describing the output fields. Nesting is supported and mirrors the
        desired output structure. Derive from data via
        :func:`ranks_from_tensordict`.
    source_data_ranks : TensorDict
        Rank-spec TensorDict describing per-source features. The number of rank-0 leaves determines scalar input
        width; rank-1 leaves determine vector input width.
    global_data_ranks : TensorDict
        Rank-spec TensorDict describing global conditioning features.
    smoothing_radius : float, optional, default=1e-8
        Small value used to smooth power functions near zero to avoid numerical
        instabilities.
    hidden_layer_sizes : Sequence[int] or None, optional, default=None
        Sequence of hidden layer sizes for the neural network. When ``None``,
        defaults to ``[64]``.
    n_spherical_harmonics : int, optional, default=4
        Number of spherical harmonic terms to use as features.
    network_type : {"pade", "mlp"}, optional, default="pade"
        Type of neural network to use for the kernel function.
    spectral_norm : bool, optional, default=False
        Whether to apply spectral normalization to network weights.
    use_gradient_checkpointing : bool, optional, default=True
        If ``True``, applies ``torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint`` during
        training to trade compute for memory. Disable for small models or
        when profiling.

    Forward
    -------
    reference_length : Float[torch.Tensor, ""]
        Scalar reference length scale used to convert position-based features
        into dimensionless quantities.
    source_points : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources n_dims"]
        Physical coordinates of the source points, which are the centers of
        the influence fields. Shape :math:`(N_{sources}, D)`.
    target_points : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets n_dims"]
        Physical coordinates of the target points where the field is evaluated.
        Shape :math:`(N_{targets}, D)`.
    source_strengths : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources"] or None, optional, default=None
        Scalar strength values associated with each source point. Shape
        :math:`(N_{sources},)`. Defaults to all ones if ``None``.
    source_data : TensorDict or None, optional, default=None
        Per-source features with ``batch_size=(N_sources,)``. Contains a mix
        of scalar (rank-0) and vector (rank-1) tensors; the kernel splits
        them internally via :func:`split_by_leaf_rank`. Leaf keys and ranks
        must match ``source_data_ranks``. All values must be dimensionless.
    global_data : TensorDict or None, optional, default=None
        Problem-level features with ``batch_size=()``. Contains a mix of
        scalar (rank-0) and vector (rank-1) tensors; split internally.
        Leaf keys and ranks must match ``global_data_ranks``. All values
        must be dimensionless.

    Outputs
    -------
    TensorDict[str, Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets ..."]]
        TensorDict with batch_size :math:`(N_{targets},)` containing the computed
        fields. Each scalar field has shape :math:`(N_{targets},)` and each vector
        field has shape :math:`(N_{targets}, D)`.

class BarnesHutKernel(Kernel):
    r"""Tree-accelerated kernel evaluation via Barnes-Hut monopole approximation.

    Reduces the :math:`O(N_{src} \cdot N_{tgt})` cost of the all-to-all kernel
    evaluation to :math:`O((N_{src} + N_{tgt}) \log N_{src})` by building a
    spatial cluster tree over source points and using aggregate (monopole)
    representations for distant clusters.

    For each target point, sources are classified as either:

    - **Near-field**: within the opening-angle threshold, evaluated exactly
      using the underlying :class:`Kernel`'s neural network.
    - **Far-field**: beyond the threshold, approximated by evaluating the
      same network with the cluster's area-weighted centroid, average normal,
      and average features as a "virtual source."

    Both near- and far-field interactions are accumulated into a single batch
    and evaluated in one call to :meth:`Kernel._evaluate_interactions`,
    minimizing kernel launch overhead ("accumulate pairs, evaluate once").

    The ``ClusterTree`` spatial structure can be precomputed per mesh geometry
    and reused across kernel branches and hyperlayers. The
    ``DualInteractionPlan`` can be cached when targets equal sources
    (communication hyperlayers).

    Parameters
    ----------
    Inherits all parameters from :class:`Kernel`.

    leaf_size : int, optional, default=1
        Maximum sources per tree leaf node. Larger values produce shallower
        trees (fewer traversal iterations) at the cost of more exact
        interactions per leaf.

    Forward
    -------
    Same parameters as :class:`Kernel`, with additions:

    theta : float, optional, default=1.0
        Barnes-Hut opening angle.  A node is approximated when
        ``D/r < theta``.  Larger values are more aggressive (more
        approximation, faster).  At ``theta = 0``, all interactions
        are exact.
    cluster_tree : ClusterTree or None, optional, default=None
        Precomputed spatial tree over source points. If ``None``, built
        from ``source_points`` on each call.
    dual_plan : DualInteractionPlan or None, optional, default=None
        Precomputed dual traversal plan. If ``None``, computed from the
        trees and target points on each call.
    source_areas : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources"] or None, optional, default=None
        Per-source areas for aggregate weighting. Defaults to ones.
    source_aggregates : SourceAggregates or None, optional, default=None
        Precomputed per-node aggregates. If ``None``, computed on each
        call.  Pass this to avoid redundant computation across branches.

    Outputs
    -------
    TensorDict[str, Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets ..."]]
        Approximate kernel output, converging to the exact result as
        ``theta`` approaches zero.

        r"""Evaluate the kernel with dual-tree Barnes-Hut acceleration.

        Uses two separate evaluation phases:

        - **Phase A (near-field)**: individual target-source pairs from
          nearby leaf nodes, evaluated exactly with chunked processing.
        - **Phase B (far-field node pairs)**: the kernel is evaluated ONCE
          at ``(centroid_T, centroid_S, avg_data_S)`` per well-separated
          node pair, then broadcast to all individual targets in the
          target node via scatter_add.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reference_length : Float[torch.Tensor, ""]
            Reference length scale for nondimensionalization.
        source_points : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources n_dims"]
            Source point coordinates.
        target_points : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets n_dims"]
            Target point coordinates.
        source_strengths : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources"] or None
            Per-source strength weights. Defaults to ones.
        source_data : TensorDict or None
            Per-source features (normals, latents).
        global_data : TensorDict or None
            Problem-level conditioning features.
        theta : float
            Barnes-Hut opening angle (larger = more aggressive).
        cluster_tree : ClusterTree or None
            Precomputed source tree. Built on-the-fly if ``None``.
        target_tree : ClusterTree or None
            Precomputed target tree. Built on-the-fly if ``None``.
            For self-interaction (comm layers), pass the same tree as
            ``cluster_tree``.
        dual_plan : DualInteractionPlan or None
            Precomputed dual traversal plan. Computed on-the-fly if ``None``.
        source_areas : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources"] or None
            Per-source areas for aggregate weighting. Defaults to ones.
        source_aggregates : SourceAggregates or None
            Precomputed per-node source aggregates.
        target_centroids : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_target_nodes n_dims"] or None
            Per-node centroids for the target tree. If ``None`` and
            ``target_tree is cluster_tree`` (self-interaction), source
            aggregates' centroids are reused. Otherwise computed from
            the target tree.
        near_chunk_size : int or None
            Fixed chunk size for near-field pair processing. When provided,
            overrides :meth:`_auto_chunk_size`. Pass this from an outer scope
            to ensure deterministic chunking inside ``torch.utils.checkpoint``
            replay (free GPU memory changes between forward and backward,
            so ``_auto_chunk_size`` would return different values).
        expand_far_targets : bool, optional, default=False
            If ``True``, far-field node pairs are expanded to individual
            target points during plan construction, eliminating the
            target-side centroid broadcast.  Passed through to
            :meth:`ClusterTree.find_dual_interaction_pairs`.

        Returns
        -------
        TensorDict[str, Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets ..."]]
            Kernel output fields at target points.

        """Run :meth:`_gather_and_evaluate` with optional gradient checkpointing.

        The four BH-kernel phases (near, far_node, nf, fn) all wrap the
        same ``_gather_and_evaluate`` call in an
        ``if self.use_gradient_checkpointing`` branch with identical
        checkpoint kwargs.  Hoisting the branch removes ~30 lines of
        duplicated forward/checkpoint plumbing across the four phases
        and keeps the gradient-checkpointing policy in one place.

        The wrap fires in **both** training and eval, not just training,
        for two reasons:

        1. Memory savings (the original purpose).  In eval no autograd
           tape is active (``train.py`` wraps validation in
           ``torch.no_grad()``), so ``checkpoint(use_reentrant=False)``
           degenerates to a near-no-op forward call - no recompute, no
           extra memory, no extra compute.
        2. Workaround for a Dynamo+CUDA TensorDict bug.  When the same
           ``_gather_and_evaluate`` body is inlined into the parent
           graph (i.e. without the checkpoint wrapper), FakeTensor
           tracing fails to propagate ``TensorDict.batch_size`` through
           ``(vectors * vectors).sum(dim=-1)``: leaf tensors get
           reduced to 1D but the TD still reports its 2D pre-reduction
           batch size, and any downstream op that consults
           ``batch_size`` (``.unsqueeze(-1)``, ``concatenate_leaves``'s
           reshape) trips on the inconsistency.  Wrapping the call in
           ``checkpoint`` gives Dynamo a fresh sub-tracer scope that
           tracks the post-reduction batch size correctly, so the
           identical eager-mode-correct body now also traces correctly.

class MultiscaleKernel(Module):
    r"""Multiscale kernel composition that linearly combines kernels at different length scales.

    This class implements the multiscale kernel architecture described in paper Section 3.3.
    Physical systems often exhibit phenomena at multiple characteristic length scales
    (e.g., viscous boundary layer thickness, geometric features, wakes).
    :class:`MultiscaleKernel` creates independent kernel branches for each reference
    length, allowing each to specialize at different spatial scales while sharing the
    same functional form.

    Each kernel branch:

    - Operates at a user-specified reference length (e.g., ``viscous_length``,
      ``chord_length``)
    - Has its own learnable parameters (separate neural network weights)
    - Has a learnable scale adjustment factor (``log_scalefactor``) that fine-tunes its
      effective reference length during training
    - Receives the same inputs but normalizes relative positions by its effective length
    - Has separate per-source, per-branch strength values

    The outputs from all branches are linearly summed, forming a multiscale superposition.
    This enables efficient representation of fields with disparate spatial scales without
    requiring a single network to span the entire range.

    Additionally, log-ratios of all reference length pairs are automatically added as
    global scalar features. This provides scale relationship information and enables the
    model to behave equivariantly under uniform scaling when all nondimensional parameters
    (e.g., Reynolds number) are held constant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_spatial_dims : int
        Number of spatial dimensions (2 or 3).
    output_field_ranks : TensorDict
        Rank-spec TensorDict (see :class:`Kernel`).
    reference_length_names : Sequence[str]
        Sequence of identifiers for reference length scales. Each creates an
        independent kernel branch. Examples: ``["viscous", "geometric"]``.
    source_data_ranks : TensorDict or None, optional
        Rank-spec TensorDict for per-source features (see :class:`Kernel`).
    global_data_ranks : TensorDict or None, optional
        Rank-spec TensorDict for global features (see :class:`Kernel`).
        Log-ratios of reference lengths are automatically added as scalar
        entries before passing to each kernel branch.
    smoothing_radius : float, optional, default=1e-8
        Small value for numerical stability in magnitude computations.
    hidden_layer_sizes : Sequence[int] or None, optional, default=None
        Hidden layer sizes for kernel networks.

        Mapping of reference length names to scalar tensors.
    source_points : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_sources n_dims"]

    target_points : Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets n_dims"]
        Physical coordinates of the target points. Shape :math:`(N_{targets}, D)`.
    source_strengths : TensorDict[str, Float[torch.Tensor, " n_sources"]] or None, optional, default=None
        Per-source, per-branch strength values. TensorDict keyed by
        ``reference_length_names``. Defaults to all ones.
    source_data : TensorDict or None, optional, default=None
        Per-source features with ``batch_size=(N_sources,)``. Mixed-rank
        TensorDict passed through to each :class:`BarnesHutKernel` branch.
    global_data : TensorDict or None, optional, default=None
        Problem-level features with ``batch_size=()``. Automatically
        augmented with log-ratios of reference lengths before being passed
        to each kernel branch.
    theta : float, optional, default=1.0
        Barnes-Hut opening angle (larger = more aggressive).
    cluster_tree : ClusterTree or None, optional, default=None
        Pre-built cluster tree for source points.  If ``None``, one is
        built from ``source_points`` using the kernel's ``leaf_size``.
    target_tree : ClusterTree or None, optional, default=None
        Pre-built target tree.  For self-interaction, pass the same tree
        as ``cluster_tree``.
    dual_plan : DualInteractionPlan or None, optional, default=None
        Pre-computed dual traversal plan.  If ``None``, computed from trees.
    source_areas : Float[torch.Tensor, " n_sources"] or None, optional, default=None
        Area weight per source, used for cluster aggregation.

    Outputs

    TensorDict[str, Float[torch.Tensor, "n_targets ..."]]
        TensorDict with the summed results from all kernel branches. Each scalar
        field has shape :math:`(N_{targets},)` and each vector field has shape
