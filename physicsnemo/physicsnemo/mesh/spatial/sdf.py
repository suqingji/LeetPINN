"""Mesh-native signed distance field over a triangle surface mesh.

This signed distance field is built entirely on the spatial acceleration
structures of :mod:`physicsnemo.mesh.spatial`: the nearest-triangle
acceleration structure is a :class:`physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.BVH`, and
distances/signs are computed with plain PyTorch tensor ops. The winding-number
sign is computed with a :class:`physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.ClusterTree` Barnes-Hut
summation over the mesh, so the whole pipeline reuses the mesh's own spatial
data structures and runs identically on CPU and GPU.

:func:`signed_distance_field_mesh` returns the signed distance and the closest
surface point for each query.

Algorithm
---------
1. **Nearest triangle**: a bounded-stack depth-first traversal of the
   morton-LBVH built over triangle AABBs. Each query descends the nearer child
   first with a per-query stack, pruning any node whose AABB lower-bound distance
   exceeds the running best exact triangle distance. Peak memory is
   ``O(n_queries * tree_depth)`` -- it never materializes a breadth-first
   ``(query, node)`` frontier.
2. **Exact distance + closest point**: standard point-to-triangle region
   classification (clamp barycentric coordinates to the triangle), giving the
   unsigned distance and the closest point on the surface.
3. **Sign**:
   - ``use_sign_winding_number=False`` (default): angle-weighted pseudo-normal
     at the closest feature (face / edge / vertex). Robust for watertight meshes.
   - ``use_sign_winding_number=True``: the generalized winding number (solid
     angle sum, Jacobson et al. 2013), evaluated with a
     :class:`physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.ClusterTree` dual-tree Barnes-Hut
     summation. Robust for non-watertight / self-intersecting meshes and scales
     to large meshes as ``O(n_queries * log n_faces)``. The exact
     ``O(n_queries * n_faces)`` sum (:func:`_winding_number_sign`) is retained
     as a reference oracle for testing.

    r"""Nearest triangle per query via a bounded-stack depth-first BVH search.

    This is the standard closest-point-on-mesh traversal. Each query keeps an
    explicit fixed-size stack and descends the **nearer child first**, carrying a
    running squared distance ``best_dist_sq`` to its closest triangle so far; a
    subtree is pruned the instant its AABB lower-bound exceeds that bound. Diving
    straight to a leaf makes the bound tight on the very first descent, so the
    far sibling at each level is almost always pruned on the way back up and each
    query visits ``O(log n_faces)`` nodes.

    The data structure is the whole point. A breadth-first ``(query, node)``
    frontier materializes *every* live node for *every* query at once, costing
    ``O(n_queries * nodes_within_radius)`` memory -- catastrophic for interior
    volume points whose distance shell intersects a large patch of surface. A
    per-query stack is instead bounded by the tree depth, so peak memory is
    ``O(n_queries * tree_depth)``, independent of mesh complexity or how far the
    query sits from the surface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bvh : BVH
        BVH built over the triangle AABBs (``BVH.from_mesh``). Must be a binary
        tree whose depth is logarithmic in ``n_faces`` (the midpoint-split LBVH
        is balanced), so a stack sized to a small multiple of the depth suffices.
    face_vertices : torch.Tensor
        Per-face vertex positions, shape ``(n_faces, 3, 3)``.
    query : torch.Tensor
        Query points, shape ``(n_queries, 3)``.
    max_dist : float
        Search radius: triangles farther than this are ignored. Pass
        ``float("inf")`` for an unbounded, exact nearest search. A query with no
        triangle within ``max_dist`` returns ``best_dist_sq == max_dist ** 2``
        and ``best_point == query`` (an unchanged closest point), which the
        caller treats as a miss.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]

    r"""Sign of the SDF via the angle-weighted pseudo-normal of the hit feature.

    The sign is :math:`\mathrm{sign}((\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}) \cdot \mathbf{N})`,
    where :math:`\mathbf{p}` is the closest surface point and :math:`\mathbf{N}`
    is the *angle-weighted pseudo-normal* of the mesh feature that :math:`p` lies
    on -- not merely the nearest face normal. Picking a single face normal is
    wrong whenever :math:`p` lands on an edge or vertex shared by several faces
    (sharp or non-convex geometry): the query can sit behind that one face's
    half-plane while still being outside the solid, which flips the sign (and,
    near edges, corrupts the signed magnitude). Resolving the feature removes the
    ambiguity:

    - **face interior** -> the face normal :math:`\mathbf{n}_f`;
    - **edge** -> the sum of the normals of the faces sharing it,
      :math:`\sum_f \mathbf{n}_f` (see :func:`_edge_pseudonormals`);
    - **vertex** :math:`v` -> the incident-angle-weighted sum
      :math:`\sum_f \alpha_f(v)\,\mathbf{n}_f`, via
      :meth:`~physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh.compute_point_normals` with ``"angle"``
      weighting.

    Only the *direction* of :math:`\mathbf{N}` affects the sign, so the
    per-vertex normalization applied by ``compute_point_normals`` is harmless.
    The feature is classified from the barycentric region of :math:`p` on the
    hit triangle (Ericson, *Real-Time Collision Detection*). This is robust on
    watertight meshes; for non-watertight surfaces use the winding-number sign.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : Mesh
        Triangle surface mesh (provides ``cells``, ``points``, cached
        ``cell_normals``, and angle-weighted ``compute_point_normals``).

    :func:`_winding_number_sign`, and -- unlike a hand-written CUDA/Triton
    kernel -- runs identically on CPU and GPU because the tree is plain PyTorch.

    The summation builds a source tree over the triangle (area-weighted)
    centroids and a target tree over the query points, then evaluates the
    dual-tree interaction plan
    (:meth:`ClusterTree.find_dual_interaction_pairs`) with
    ``expand_far_targets=True`` so the dominant far-field stream is expanded to
    individual query points (no target-side approximation). Each interaction
    stream contributes to the per-query winding number:

    - **(near, near)**: the exact triangle solid angle, evaluated at the real
      query point.
    - **(near, far)**: the source node's dipole (sum of area-weighted normals)
      evaluated at the real query point, ``N_node . (p_node - q) / |p_node -
      q|^3``.
    - **(far, near)**: the exact triangle solid angle evaluated at the target

        face normal would flip the sign (see :func:`_pseudo_normal_sign`). The
        mesh should be watertight for reliable signs in the ``False`` case.
    winding_backend : str, optional
        Winding-number summation backend when ``use_sign_winding_number=True``: ``"clustertree"`` (default) for the :class:`physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.ClusterTree` Barnes-Hut sum (``O(n_queries * log n_faces)``, best for large meshes), or ``"bruteforce"`` for the exact fused ``O(n_queries * n_faces)`` sum (faster for small/medium meshes).

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]
        ``(sdf, hit_points)``: signed distance per query
        (shape ``query_points.shape[:-1]``) and the closest point on the mesh
        per query (shape ``query_points.shape``).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``mesh`` is not a triangle surface in 3D (``n_spatial_dims == 3`` and
        ``n_manifold_dims == 2``), if ``query_points`` does not have a trailing
        dimension of size 3, or if the mesh has no faces (there is no surface to
        measure distance to).

    Notes
    -----
    A finite ``max_dist`` is an opt-in optimization/narrow-band mode: it prunes
    the search to the given radius and marks out-of-band queries as ``NaN`` so a
    far query is never silently reported as on-surface (``sdf == 0``). The
    unbounded default never produces ``NaN`` for a non-empty mesh.

       :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh`, instead.

       This helper is unexported, carries no backward-compatibility guarantee,
       and may be removed without notice.

    It wraps the arrays in a :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh` and defers to
    :func:`signed_distance_field_mesh`, so the numerics are identical.

    Parameters
    ----------

    query_points : torch.Tensor
        Query points, shape ``(..., 3)``.
    max_dist : float or None, optional
        Maximum search radius; see :func:`signed_distance_field_mesh`.
