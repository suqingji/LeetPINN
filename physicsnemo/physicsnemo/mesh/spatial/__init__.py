"""Spatial acceleration structures for efficient queries on large meshes.

This module provides data structures and algorithms for fast spatial queries:
- BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) for point-in-cell queries
- ClusterTree for dual-tree Barnes-Hut acceleration of kernel/attention operators
- Signed distance field (:func:`signed_distance_field_mesh`) over a triangle
  surface mesh, backed by the BVH (nearest triangle) and the ClusterTree
  (winding-number sign)
