    r"""Extract an isosurface from a 3D scalar field using marching cubes.

    Given a volumetric scalar field (e.g. a signed distance field), this
    function extracts the isosurface at the specified threshold and returns
    it as a triangle :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh`.

    When ``coords`` is provided, vertex positions are mapped from grid-index
    space into the physical coordinate system defined by the coordinate
    vectors. When ``coords`` is ``None``, vertices are returned in grid-index
    space.

    Uses `NVIDIA Warp <https://nvidia.github.io/warp/modules/runtime.html#marching-cubes>`_
    for the marching cubes implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : torch.Tensor
        A 3D scalar field with shape :math:`(N_x, N_y, N_z)`. Converted to
        float32 internally if necessary.
    threshold : float, optional
        Iso-value at which to extract the surface. Default is ``0.0``, which
        is the standard choice for signed distance fields.
    coords : tuple of 3 torch.Tensor, optional
        Physical coordinates along each grid axis, as 1D tensors of lengths
        :math:`N_x`, :math:`N_y`, :math:`N_z` respectively (e.g. from
        ``torch.linspace``). When provided, output vertices are mapped from
        grid-index space into physical space via piecewise linear
        interpolation along each axis. Both uniform and non-uniform grids
        are supported. When ``None``, vertices are in grid-index space.

    Returns
    -------
    Mesh
        A triangle mesh with ``points`` of shape :math:`(N_v, 3)` (float32)
        and ``cells`` of shape :math:`(N_f, 3)` (int64).

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``field`` is not 3-dimensional (higher/lower dimensions may be
        supported in a future release).
    ValueError
        If ``coords`` is provided but the lengths do not match the
        corresponding ``field`` dimensions.

    Notes
    -----
    This operation is **not differentiable**. The input tensor is detached
    and transferred to CPU/NumPy before being passed to Warp's marching cubes
    kernel, so gradients do not flow through this function.

    Examples
    --------
    Extract the zero-level set of a sphere SDF on a 64^3 grid in physical
    coordinates:

    >>> import torch
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh.generate import marching_cubes
    >>> coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, 64)
    >>> xx, yy, zz = torch.meshgrid(coords, coords, coords, indexing="ij")
    >>> sdf = torch.sqrt(xx**2 + yy**2 + zz**2) - 0.5
    >>> sphere = marching_cubes(sdf, threshold=0.0, coords=(coords, coords, coords))
    >>> sphere.n_manifold_dims
    2
    >>> sphere.n_spatial_dims
