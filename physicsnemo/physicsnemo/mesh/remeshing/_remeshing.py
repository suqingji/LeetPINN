### Optional dependency. ``pyacvd`` is a lazy proxy: construction does not
### import the package; the friendly ``ImportError`` (with the
### ``[mesh-extras]`` install hint) fires only on first attribute access. The
### ``@require_version_spec("pyacvd")`` decorator on ``remesh`` raises that
### same error proactively before any function-body work happens.

    """Uniform remeshing of a 2D triangle surface (in 3D) via clustering.

    Creates a simplified mesh with approximately ``n_clusters`` vertices
    uniformly distributed across the geometry. Uses the ACVD (Approximate
    Centroidal Voronoi Diagram) clustering algorithm.

    The algorithm:
    1. Weights vertices by their dual volumes (Voronoi areas)
    2. Initializes clusters via area-based region growing
    3. Minimizes energy by iteratively reassigning vertices
    4. Reconstructs a simplified mesh from cluster adjacency

    This is restricted to 2D triangle surfaces embedded in 3D space -- the only
    case the underlying ``pyacvd`` ACVD clustering supports.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : Mesh
        Input mesh to remesh
    n_clusters : int
        Target number of output vertices. The actual number may vary
        slightly depending on mesh topology.

    Returns
    -------
    Mesh
        Remeshed mesh with approximately ``n_clusters`` vertices. The vertices are
        cluster centroids, and cells connect adjacent clusters.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If the mesh is not a 2D triangle surface embedded in 3D.
    ImportError
        If the optional ``pyacvd`` dependency is not installed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh.primitives.surfaces import sphere_icosahedral
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh.remeshing import remesh
    >>> mesh = sphere_icosahedral.load(subdivisions=3)
    >>> # Remesh a triangle mesh to approximately 100 cluster centroids
    >>> simplified = remesh(mesh, n_clusters=100)
    >>> assert simplified.n_cells > 0

    Notes
    -----
    - Restricted to 2D triangle surfaces embedded in 3D (``pyacvd`` limitation)
    - Preserves mesh topology qualitatively but not quantitatively
    - Point and cell data are not transferred (topology changes fundamentally)
    - Output cell orientation may differ from input
