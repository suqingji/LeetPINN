Forward-kwargs spec resolver.

Each model YAML supplies a `forward_kwargs:` block that maps the model's
`forward()` keyword arguments to declarative paths into a `DomainMesh` (or
`Mesh`). At collate time, this module turns that spec into the actual
`dict[str, Any]` ready to splat into `model.forward(**kwargs)`.

Spec value semantics:

- Strings are dotted paths into the source, walked via getattr-then-getitem
  (e.g., ``"interior.points"``, ``"boundaries.vehicle.cell_data.normals"``,
  ``"global_data.U_inf"``). The empty string ``""`` and the literal ``"."``
  resolve to the source itself.
- Numbers (int / float / bool) become 0-d float32 tensors.
- Lists trigger ``torch.cat`` along the last dim of the resolved entries
  (used for tensor-input models that want concatenated feature vectors).
- Dicts recurse and produce dict-valued kwargs (used for mesh-input models
  with dict-valued args like GLOBE's ``boundary_meshes`` and
  ``reference_lengths``).
- "Modifier" dicts -- dicts containing a ``"source"`` key plus one of the
  recognized modifier keys (currently only ``"expand_like"``) -- are
  deferred to a second resolution pass so they may reference other already-
  resolved kwargs. ``{source: <path>, expand_like: <other_kwarg>}``
  extracts ``source`` and expands the result along axis ``-2`` to match
  the resolved value of ``<other_kwarg>``; this is how a per-sample tensor
  (e.g. a freestream vector) gets broadcast across the per-cell axis of a
  per-element kwarg.

Targets are extracted separately by :func:`extract_targets` from the
DomainMesh's ``interior.point_data``, by convention.
