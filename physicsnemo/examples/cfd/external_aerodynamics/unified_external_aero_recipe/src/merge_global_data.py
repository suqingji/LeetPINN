Reader extension that merges an external on-disk ``TensorDict`` into each
sample's ``global_data`` at load time.

This recipe's surface configs read a boundary :class:`Mesh` directly out
of a parent :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.DomainMesh`'s on-disk tensordict
tree (e.g. ``.../*.pdmsh/_tensordict/boundaries/vehicle``).  The boundary
tensordict's own ``global_data`` carries little or nothing of the
case-level metadata -- the freestream conditions (``U_inf``,
``rho_inf``, ``p_inf``, ``T_inf``, ``L_ref``) live on the *domain-level*
``_tensordict/global_data`` instead.  :class:`MeshReaderWithGlobalData`
walks a configurable relative path from each sample directory, loads
the tensordict it points at, and merges its keys into the boundary
``Mesh``'s ``global_data`` so downstream transforms
(:class:`NonDimensionalizeByMetadata`, ``RandomRotateMesh`` with
``transform_global_data: true``, ...) can read them straight off the
loaded sample.

Recipe-local module registered into the global datapipe component
registry so the class can be referenced via
``${dp:MeshReaderWithGlobalData}`` in Hydra YAML configs.  Import this
module before Hydra instantiation.

class MeshReaderWithGlobalData(MeshReader):
    r"""MeshReader that merges an external tensordict into each Mesh's ``global_data``.

    Identical to :class:`MeshReader` except for the
    ``merge_global_data_from`` parameter, which names a path
    *relative to each matched sample* pointing to a saved
    ``TensorDict`` directory whose keys should be merged into the
    loaded :class:`Mesh`'s ``global_data``.  If a key appears in
    both the boundary's ``global_data`` and the external one, a
    :class:`ValueError` is raised: ``global_data`` is case-level
    by construction, so overlap is ambiguous and treated as a
    data-layer bug rather than silently resolved.

    This is intended for boundary tensordicts whose own
    ``global_data`` is empty (or only carries dataset-local fields
    like ``TimeValue``) but whose parent
    :class:`~physicsnemo.mesh.DomainMesh` carries the case-level
    freestream conditions (``U_inf``, ``rho_inf``, ``p_inf``, ...).
    Without this hook the boundary-only surface pipeline cannot see
    those parent fields.

    Example YAML::

        reader:
          _target_: ${dp:MeshReaderWithGlobalData}
          path: ${train_datadir}
          pattern: "run_*/*.pdmsh/_tensordict/boundaries/vehicle"
          # Walk up to the parent DomainMesh's global_data tensordict
          merge_global_data_from: "../../global_data"

    Parameters
    ----------
    merge_global_data_from : str or None
        Path *relative to each matched sample directory* of an
        on-disk ``TensorDict`` directory (one containing
        ``meta.json`` plus ``*.memmap`` files).  When ``None``
        (default) this class behaves exactly like
        :class:`MeshReader`.
    **kwargs
        Forwarded to :class:`MeshReader`.
