SDF (Signed Distance Field) pipeline transforms for volume meshes.

Provides a transform that computes SDF + normals from a boundary surface
onto interior volume points, and a cleanup transform to drop temporary
boundaries before TensorDict conversion.

These work with ``DomainMeshReader``'s ``extra_boundaries`` parameter,
which loads a sibling STL mesh at full resolution alongside the domain
mesh.  The SDF transform reads the injected boundary, computes the
signed distance field, and writes results into ``interior.point_data``.

Recipe-local module registered into the global datapipe component
registry so components can be referenced via ``${dp:...}`` in Hydra
YAML configs.

Import this module before Hydra instantiation to register the components.

class ComputeSDFFromBoundary(MeshTransform):
    r"""Compute SDF and optionally normals from a boundary surface onto interior points.

    Reads the surface mesh from ``domain.boundaries[boundary_name]`` and
    evaluates the signed distance field at every interior point using
    :func:`physicsnemo.mesh.spatial.sdf.signed_distance_field_mesh`,
    a mesh-native, pure-PyTorch implementation backed by a torch BVH.

    The computed SDF is stored as a scalar field ``(N, 1)`` in
    ``interior.point_data[sdf_field]``.  If ``normals_field`` is set,
    approximate surface normals ``(N, 3)`` are also stored, computed as
    the normalized direction from each query point to its closest point
    on the surface (with center-of-mass fallback for on-surface points).

    Parameters
    ----------
    boundary_name : str
        Key of the boundary mesh to use as the SDF surface.
    sdf_field : str
        Name for the SDF field in ``interior.point_data``.
    normals_field : str or None
        Optional name for the normals field.  ``None`` to skip.
    use_winding_number : bool
        Whether to use winding-number sign computation.  Required for
        non-watertight meshes; slightly slower.
