class StormCastDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset, ABC):
    """An abstract class that defines the interface for StormCast datasets.

    All datasets must inherit from this class and implement the methods marked as @abstractmethod.
    The other methods have default implementations and can be overridden by the dataset if needed,
    for example to provide a normalization scheme.

    In addition to the methods defined below, all datasets must also implement the following:
    - `__init__`, which should accept a `params` argument containing the dataset parameters
        and a `train` argument indicating whether the dataset is for training or validation
    - `__len__`, which should return the number of samples in the dataset
    - `__getitem__`, which should return a dictionary containing the following keys:
        - `background`: a numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor of shape
            `(num_channels_background, height, width)` containing the background data
        - `state`: a 2-tuple of numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor of shape
            `(num_channels_state, height, width)` with index 0 containing the input state data
            and index 1 containing the target state data
        - `lead_time_label` (optional): this must be returned if lead_time_steps > 0. A single
            integer indicating which lead time embedding should be used
        - `mask` (optional): a numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor with values in {0, 1}
            (or boolean), where 1/True marks valid pixels and 0/False marks
            invalid/excluded pixels (e.g. outside sensor coverage, LAM padding zones,
            land-sea boundaries).  The shape must broadcast with `(num_channels_state,
            height, width)`: use `(1, height, width)` for a spatial mask shared across
            all channels, `(num_channels_state, height, width)` for per-channel spatial
            masks, or `(num_channels_state, 1, 1)` to mark entire channels as invalid.
            When provided, the training loop uses the mask as a per-pixel loss weight.
            For the DiT architecture with `use_nan_mask_tokens=True`, a spatial invalid
            mask is derived (any channel invalid → token invalid) and used to replace
            invalid-region tokens with learned mask tokens.  The dataset is responsible
            for producing this mask; caching internally is encouraged when the pattern
            is static across samples.

        The outputs of __getitem__ should be already normalized (this is not done in the training
        loop for performance reasons).

    An example implementation of a dataset is given in `data_loader_hrrr_era5.py`.
